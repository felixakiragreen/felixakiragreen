### Main quest:

As of 2021, the majority of my time is building projects at [Ambition](https://ambition.wtf) with my friends. We’ve created a few projects I’m really proud of like:
- “The Worm” → a semi-autonomous agent living in the Ethereum VM featuring the first “share-to-mint” & “soul-bound” mechanics.
- The “lil fks” → fully on-chain characters featuring a dynamic genetic mutation system that you can endlessly mutate.
- CryptoJunks → the funniest CryptoPunks parody project, featuring over 1400 traits, created with a custom in-house pixel drawing & generator I built called JunkDrawer.

### Side quests:

golOS (game of life operating system) → _An attempt at creating a game-like interface for living life._
> A project I’ve been working on for as long as I can remember, currently on the 3rd major iteration of prototypes. The most grandiose & ambitious of all my projects, the one I want to spend a significant fraction of my life on, and be known for after I am gone.

### Inactive quests
> _looking for help with_

- VisaViz → “a tool for (data)visualizing ALL of a person’s (@VisakanV) tweets”.
- Akira → a typeface based on my own handwriting.
